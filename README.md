gplus-friends (work in progress - not working)
=============

A simple Android app that shows how to:

* how to use ContentProviders
* how to use AsyncTasks
* how to deal with Activities lifecyles
* how to get data from a REST webservice in background
* how to use Google+ API in multiple Activities

To run this project you'll need:

* Eclipse Luna
* Android SDK
* debug.keystore --> you must put it on ~/.android, otherwise G+ API won't work

That's all !
